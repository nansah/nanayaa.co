                    <p> Over the past 2 years, I've been desinging websies for my clients using the Squarespace website
                        builder and Shopify. I've geenrated five figues in business revenue serving clients in the b2b
                        and service provider space. I decided to brush up on HTML, CSS, and Javascript and recreated my
                        portfolio website. </p>
